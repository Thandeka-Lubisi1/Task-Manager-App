GENERAL DEVELOPMENT QUESTIONS - ANSWERS

1. Explain the difference between an API integration error and a logic error.

   API Integration Error:
   - Occurs when there are communication issues between different systems or services
   - Examples: incorrect endpoints, wrong HTTP methods, authentication failures, network timeouts
   - Usually results in HTTP error codes (4xx, 5xx) or connection failures
   - Can be identified through network monitoring, API logs, or HTTP response codes
   - Often requires checking API documentation, network configuration, or service availability

   Logic Error:
   - Occurs when the application's business logic or algorithms don't work as intended
   - Examples: incorrect calculations, wrong conditional logic, improper data transformations
   - Usually results in incorrect output or unexpected behavior rather than crashes
   - Can be identified through unit testing, code review, or debugging with sample data
   - Requires analyzing the actual code logic and understanding the intended behavior

2. What steps would you take to troubleshoot a non-responsive API call?

   a) Check Network Connectivity:
      - Verify internet connection and firewall settings
      - Test if the API endpoint is reachable (ping, telnet, or browser)

   b) Verify API Endpoint:
      - Confirm the correct URL and endpoint path
      - Check if the API service is running and accessible
      - Verify SSL certificates if using HTTPS

   c) Check Request Details:
      - Validate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
      - Verify required headers (Content-Type, Authorization, etc.)
      - Check request payload format and size

   d) Monitor Response:
      - Check HTTP status codes and response headers
      - Look for error messages in response body
      - Monitor network tab in browser dev tools

   e) Check Server Logs:
      - Review API server logs for errors
      - Check database connectivity and performance
      - Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)

   f) Test with Different Tools:
      - Use Postman or similar API testing tools
      - Test with curl or other command-line tools
      - Compare behavior across different clients

3. Why is it important to separate frontend and backend responsibilities?

   a) Maintainability:
      - Each layer can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
      - Changes to one layer don't necessarily affect the other
      - Easier to assign different developers to different layers

   b) Scalability:
      - Frontend and backend can be scaled independently based on demand
      - Can deploy multiple frontend instances while keeping one backend
      - Different technologies can be chosen for each layer based on requirements

   c) Security:
      - Backend can implement proper authentication and authorization
      - Sensitive business logic stays on the server
      - Frontend can focus on user experience without security concerns

   d) Technology Flexibility:
      - Frontend can be built with different frameworks (Angular, React, Vue)
      - Backend can use different languages (C#, Java, Python, Node.js)
      - Each layer can evolve independently

   e) Testing:
      - Can test business logic separately from UI logic
      - Easier to write unit tests for specific functionality
      - Can mock one layer while testing the other

4. Name a testing framework or tool you have used or researched and describe its purpose.

   xUnit (C#):
   - Purpose: Unit testing framework for .NET applications
   - Features: 
     * Attribute-based test methods ([Fact], [Theory])
     * Assertion methods for validating results
     * Test discovery and execution
     * Support for test data and parameterized tests
   - Benefits: Integrates well with Visual Studio, supports async testing, extensive assertion library
   - Use Cases: Testing individual methods, classes, and business logic in isolation

   Jasmine (Angular):
   - Purpose: Behavior-driven development testing framework for JavaScript/TypeScript
   - Features:
     * Describe blocks for organizing tests
     * It blocks for individual test cases
     * BeforeEach/AfterEach for setup and teardown
     * Mocking and spying capabilities
   - Benefits: Built into Angular CLI, readable test syntax, good integration with testing utilities
   - Use Cases: Testing Angular components, services, and directives

5. How do you ensure your code remains maintainable over time?

   a) Code Organization:
      - Follow consistent naming conventions
      - Organize code into logical folders and namespaces
      - Separate concerns (business logic, data access, presentation)
      - Use design patterns where appropriate

   b) Documentation:
      - Write clear, concise comments explaining complex logic
      - Document public APIs and interfaces
      - Maintain README files with setup and usage instructions
      - Use meaningful commit messages and changelogs

   c) Testing:
      - Write comprehensive unit tests for critical functionality
      - Maintain high test coverage
      - Use integration tests for complex workflows
      - Implement automated testing in CI/CD pipelines

   d) Code Quality:
      - Use static analysis tools and linters
      - Follow coding standards and style guides
      - Conduct regular code reviews
      - Refactor complex or duplicated code

   e) Version Control:
      - Use meaningful branch names and commit messages
      - Keep commits small and focused
      - Use feature branches for new development
      - Tag releases and maintain release notes

   f) Dependency Management:
      - Keep dependencies up to date
      - Use dependency injection for loose coupling
      - Avoid tight coupling between components
      - Document external dependencies and their purposes
