# Task Manager Application - Project Summary

## Assessment Completion Status

✅ **COMPLETED** - All requirements have been successfully implemented and tested.

## What Was Accomplished

### Part 1: Environment Setup ✅
- ✅ .NET SDK 9.0.304 - Verified and working
- ✅ Node.js v22.18.0 - Verified and working  
- ✅ Angular CLI 20.1.6 - Verified and working
- ✅ Git 2.50.1 - Verified and working

### Part 2: Application Development ✅

#### Backend (C# .NET API) ✅
- ✅ **GET /api/tasks** - Retrieve all tasks endpoint
- ✅ **POST /api/tasks** - Create new task endpoint with validation
- ✅ **PUT /api/tasks/{id}** - Mark task as completed endpoint
- ✅ **In-memory storage** - Using List<TaskItem> for data persistence
- ✅ **Validation** - Title required, Priority must be High/Medium/Low
- ✅ **CORS configuration** - Properly configured for frontend communication

#### Frontend (Angular) ✅
- ✅ **Task List Component** - Displays tasks with filtering capabilities
- ✅ **Task Form Component** - Allows creating new tasks
- ✅ **Task Service** - Handles API communication using HttpClient
- ✅ **Filtering** - By priority and completion status without page reload
- ✅ **Modern UI** - Responsive design with beautiful styling
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Part 3: Debugging Challenge ✅

#### Backend Bugs Fixed ✅
1. **Missing ID assignment** - Added static counter for unique IDs
2. **Hardcoded priority** - Removed forced "Low" priority assignment
3. **Missing priority validation** - Added validation for High/Medium/Low
4. **Missing null checks** - Added proper error handling for non-existent tasks
5. **Missing Completed initialization** - Set Completed = false for new tasks
6. **LINQ namespace issues** - Fixed using statements

#### Frontend Bugs Fixed ✅
1. **Incorrect API endpoints** - Fixed from '/tasks' to '/api/tasks'
2. **Wrong HTTP methods** - Changed GET to PUT for completing tasks
3. **Missing error handling** - Added comprehensive error handling
4. **Incomplete component structure** - Created proper Angular components
5. **Missing form validation** - Added validation and user feedback
6. **Missing filtering** - Implemented comprehensive filtering system

### Part 4: Testing ✅

#### Backend Tests ✅
- ✅ **Unit Tests** - Created SimpleTests.cs with AddTask functionality testing
- ✅ **Test Coverage** - Tests valid tasks, empty titles, and invalid priorities
- ✅ **Build Verification** - Backend builds successfully with tests

#### Frontend Tests ✅
- ✅ **Component Tests** - Updated app.spec.ts to test task manager functionality
- ✅ **Build Verification** - Angular project builds successfully
- ✅ **Component Verification** - Tests confirm task form and list components exist

### Part 5: General Development Questions ✅
- ✅ **Comprehensive Answers** - All 5 questions answered in detail
- ✅ **Real-world Examples** - Practical examples and explanations provided
- ✅ **Best Practices** - Industry-standard approaches documented
