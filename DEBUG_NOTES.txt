DEBUG NOTES - Task Manager Application

BUGGY_BACKEND.CS ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing ID assignment for new tasks
   - The original code didn't assign unique IDs to new tasks
   - This would cause issues with task identification and updates
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added a static counter (nextId) that increments for each new task

2. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Hardcoded priority assignment
   - The original code always set priority to "Low" regardless of input
   - This ignored user's priority selection
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Removed the hardcoded assignment and added proper priority validation

3. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing priority validation
   - The original code didn't validate that priority values were valid
   - This could lead to invalid data in the system
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added validation to ensure priority is one of: High, Medium, Low

4. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing null check in CompleteTask
   - The original code didn't check if a task exists before trying to complete it
   - This would cause a runtime error if an invalid ID was passed
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added null check and return NotFound result for non-existent tasks

5. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing Completed property initialization
   - New tasks didn't have their Completed property set to false
   - This could lead to undefined behavior
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Explicitly set Completed = false for new tasks

6. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing using statement for LINQ
   - The Contains method requires System.Linq namespace
   - This would cause compilation errors
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added proper using statements and LINQ support

BUGGY_FRONTEND.TS ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:

1. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Incorrect API endpoint in loadTasks()
   - The original code called '/tasks' instead of '/api/tasks'
   - This would result in 404 errors
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Updated to use correct endpoint '/api/tasks'

2. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Wrong HTTP method in completeTask()
   - The original code used GET instead of PUT for completing tasks
   - This violates REST principles and wouldn't work with the backend
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Changed to use PUT method as intended

3. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing error handling
   - The original code didn't handle HTTP errors
   - This could lead to silent failures and poor user experience
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added proper error handling with console.error logging

4. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing proper component structure
   - The original code was incomplete and missing proper Angular component setup
   - This would cause compilation and runtime errors
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Created proper standalone components with complete templates and styling

5. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing form validation and user feedback
   - The original code didn't validate form inputs or provide user feedback
   - This would lead to poor user experience
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Added form validation, error messages, and proper user feedback

6. PROBLEM IDENTIFIED: Missing filtering functionality
   - The original code didn't implement the required filtering by priority and completion status
   - This was a missing requirement from the assessment
   HOW YOU FIXED IT: Implemented comprehensive filtering with dropdown selectors

ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS MADE:

1. Added proper CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication
2. Implemented comprehensive unit tests for backend functionality
3. Added proper error handling and validation throughout the application
4. Created a modern, responsive UI with proper styling
5. Implemented proper Angular standalone components architecture
6. Added proper TypeScript interfaces and type safety
7. Implemented proper HTTP service layer for API communication
